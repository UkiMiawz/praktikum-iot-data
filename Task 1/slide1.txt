The default password would be "raspberry"

- Expand the filesystem
Type "raspi-config" to set configuration parameters
We will need to resize our filesystem
Choose "Expand the filesystem"
You will see a message that the filesystem will be resized at the next boot and you'll be returned to the configuration screen. 
Use the arrow keys to highlight <Finish> and hit return.
The next screen will ask "Would you like to reboot now?". Hit return to indicate <Yes>.
Your terminal will report "Connection to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx closed" because the Raspberry Pi is rebooting.

- Housekeeping & update
Now we need to make sure that Raspberry got the latest update
SSH to your Raspberry Pi
Run "apt-get update" and then "apt-get upgrade"
